What I learned: On github so far I have learned what repositorys are, what cloning is, what commiting and pushing is, what respetories, brances, forks, and what pull rquests are. 

What I am confused about: The interface of Github seems a bit confusining at the moment, I am sure I will pick it up though as I use it more in class.
